# KeyboardGameSideProject

Sometimes when I gather with friends we play a game, which I am not sure the name of. Basically you have to write 2 words from 5 categories and then put them in a bowl, then every player from every team takes turns trying to explain the word in differnet ways (1st round is multiple words, 2nd round is 1 word and the 3rd round with no words). 
The problem is, some of us don't have good handwriting and the words are unreadable. 

I though it was a good practice to try to write a small console program to take care of it for us. 

With finishin the SoftUni JS -Fronted course, I may try to upgrade it further.
